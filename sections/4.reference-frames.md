```scheme
(import (OpenGL version-2-1))
```

We use OpenGL 2.1 as a very simple and straightforward graphics library frontend with full Shader Language support.
No preparations of index and vertex buffers, no calculations of buffers length, no many low-level moves - just begin, set a vertex, set a normal, end.

---
```scheme
(define models (prepare-models "cache.bin"))
```

We load the models cache (or generate it from the OBJ and MTL Wavefront files if cache doesn't not exist) and immediately compile the geometry as [OpenGL lists](https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter07.html).
As a result, we got a { model-name -> list-of-opengl-lists } dictionary with compiled geometry which can be rendered using glCallList(s).

---
```scheme
(define scene (read-json-file "scene1.json"))
```

Load a scene json.

---
```scheme
(define camera (ref (scene 'Cameras) 1))
```

Get the Camera (we assume that there is only one camera in the Scene and this is a main camera).

---
```scheme
(glMatrixMode GL_PROJECTION)
(glLoadIdentity)
(gluPerspective angle (/ (gl:get-window-width) (gl:get-window-height)) 0.1 100)
...
(glMatrixMode GL_MODELVIEW)
(glLoadIdentity)
(gluLookAt
   (ref location 1) (ref location 2) (ref location 3)
   (ref target 1) (ref target 2) (ref target 3)
   0 0 1))
```

Setup a ModelView and Projection matrices from the Camera using the GLU functions.

---
```scheme
(glMatrixMode GL_MODELVIEW)
(glPushMatrix)
(let ((xyz (entity 'location)))
   (glTranslatef (ref xyz 1) (ref xyz 2) (ref xyz 3)))
(let ((ypr (entity 'rotation)))
   (glRotatef (ref ypr 1) 1 0 0)
   (glRotatef (ref ypr 2) 0 1 0)
   (glRotatef (ref ypr 3) 0 0 1))
   ...
(glPopMatrix)
```

Our Scene is modular and consists of small, separate elements. Each element has a Model (which is pre-compiled into OpenGL Lists) and must be additionally transformed to the correct location in the World before rendering.
Classic OpenGL does not have a separate LocalWorld (aka LocalModel) matrix. So we need transform the global ModelView matrix every time the scene item is rendered.

This will change when we start rendering using GLSL.

---
```scheme
(for-each glCallList
   (models (string->symbol model)))
```

Draw an item Model with colors. No lighting, shading, decals, fog, blur, textures, bloom, SSAO, reflections, refractions, etc. Just a colors!
