```scheme
(import (lib gl-2))
```

We use OpenGL 2.1 as a very simple and straightforward graphics library frontend with full Shader Language support.
No preparations of index and vertex buffers, no calculations of buffers length, no many low-level steps - just begin, set a vertex, set a normal, end.

---
```scheme
(define models (prepare-models "cache.bin"))
```

We load the models cache (or generate it from the OBJ and MTL Wavefront files if cache doesn't not exist).

---
```scheme
(define geometry (compile-triangles models))
```
Compile the geometry to the [OpenGL lists](https://www.glprogramming.com/red/chapter07.html).
As a result, we got a vector of dictionaries
[{ material-name -> material } { model-name -> compiled-model }] with compiled geometry which can be rendered using glCallList(s).

---
```scheme
(define scene (read-json-file "scene.json"))
```

Load a scene json.

---
```scheme
(define Lights (vector->list (scene 'Lights)))
(define Objects (vector->list (scene 'Objects)))
```

Get scene lights and objects as global variables.

---
```scheme
(define Camera (ref (scene 'Cameras) 1))
```

Get the main camera (we assume that first camera in the Scene is a main camera).

---
```scheme
(glMatrixMode GL_PROJECTION)
(glLoadIdentity)
(gluPerspective
   (Camera 'angle)
   (/ (gl:get-window-width) (gl:get-window-height))
   (Camera 'clip_start) (Camera 'clip_end))

(define target (vector->list (Camera 'target)))
(define location (vector->list (Camera 'location)))
(define up (vector->list [0 0 1]))

(glMatrixMode GL_MODELVIEW)
(glLoadIdentity)
(apply gluLookAt (append location target up))
```

Setup a ModelView and Projection matrices from the Camera using the GLU functions.

---
```scheme
(glMatrixMode GL_MODELVIEW)
(glPushMatrix)
(let ((xyz (entity 'location)))
   (glTranslatef (ref xyz 1) (ref xyz 2) (ref xyz 3)))
(let ((ypr (entity 'rotation)))
   (glRotatef (ref ypr 3) 0 0 1)
   (glRotatef (ref ypr 2) 0 1 0)
   (glRotatef (ref ypr 1) 1 0 0))
   ...
(glPopMatrix)
```

Our Scene is modular and consists of small, separate elements. Each element has a Model (which is pre-compiled into OpenGL lists) and must be additionally transformed to the correct location in the World before rendering.
Classic OpenGL does not have a separate LocalWorld (aka LocalModel) matrix. So we need transform the global ModelView matrix every time the scene item is rendered.

This will change when we start rendering using GLSL.

---
```scheme
(define rotation (if (string-eq? (object 'name "") "ceilingFan")
   (let*((ss ms (clock)))
      [0 0 (+ (mod (* ss 10) 360) (/ ms 100))])
   (object 'rotation)))
```

We want to slightly animate our scene. So let's spin the ceiling fan.

---
```scheme
(for-each glCallList
   (map car (models (string->symbol model))))
```

Draw an item Model with colors, textures and lighting. No shading, decals, fog, blur, bloom, SSAO, reflections, refractions, etc. Just a colors!
