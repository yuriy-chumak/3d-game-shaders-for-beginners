3D Game Shaders For Beginners
=============================

This is a try to translate and extend an [lettier/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners](https://github.com/lettier/3d-game-shaders-for-beginners) articles to the Ol (Otus Lisp).

*"Interested in adding
textures,
lighting,
shadows,
normal maps,
glowing objects,
ambient occlusion,
reflections,
refractions,
and more to your 3D game?
Great!
Below is a collection of shading techniques that will take your game visuals to new heights.
I've explained each technique in such a way that you can take what you learn here and apply/port it to
whatever stack you use be it Godot, Unity, Unreal, or something else.
For the glue in between the shaders,
I've chosen the fabulous ~~Panda3D game engine~~ Otus Lisp and the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL).
So if that is your stack, then you'll also get the benefit of learning how to use these
shading techniques with ~~Panda3D~~ Ol and OpenGL specifically."*
